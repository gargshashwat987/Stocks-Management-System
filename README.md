# Stocks-Management-System
The Stock Management System is a project developed using Java and the principles of Database Management System (DBMS).


## Introduction

The Stocks Management System is designed to store and manage a large volume of information related to Stocks management. This includes employee information, shop information, product information, and more. The system replaces manual paper-based systems, providing an effective and efficient service.

## Problem Analysis

The system helps solve the problem of storing and managing stocks-related information in a fast, accurate, and systematic way. By using the system, there is a lower risk of system failure, and users can search for specific data within seconds. The Stocks Management System is specifically designed for people who handle Stocks management tasks.

## UI Design Analysis

The Stocks Management System interacts with users through the Command Line Interface, where users input commands representing different operations. The system runs different operations based on user inputs. However, a Graphical User Interface would be more user-friendly and improve the overall user experience.

## Logical Analysis

The application implements various code logic to ensure proper functioning. For example, when adding a new quantity, the system checks whether the amount is greater than zero or not. If it is, the system subtracts from the previously available quantity instead of adding a new quantity. When selling a quantity, the system checks whether the selling amount is greater than zero and smaller than the available quantity. However, the system does not check for duplicate values in shop ID, product ID, or employee ID.

## OOP Concept Analysis

The application implements the four main principles of object-oriented programming: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. Encapsulation is achieved using setter and getter methods. Inheritance is used in many classes. Polymorphism involves overriding many methods, and the system includes abstract classes and methods to implement abstraction.

## Impact of this Project

The Stocks Management System can help Stockss develop their services, fast-forward the entire management system, and increase customer interest in Stockss. The risk of losing important data is also reduced, leading to increased profitability and growth in the industry. The system's use of computer-based technology can have a positive impact on the economy and society.

## Limitations and Possible Future Improvements

The Command Line Interface is not the most user-friendly interface, and there is a risk of closing the application due to incorrect user input. Future improvements could include adding a Graphical User Interface and implementing a database to store data more efficiently. 

Overall, the Stocks Management System is a reliable, efficient, and effective solution for managing Stocks-related information.
